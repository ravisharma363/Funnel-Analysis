# Funnel-Analysis
Project Overview: Swiggy Funnel Analysis

This project involved an in-depth examination of Swiggy's performance throughout the year 2019. The primary objective was to uncover valuable insights into the company's operations and pinpoint areas for enhancement. The analysis utilized data sourced from the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, which encompasses three crucial worksheets.

Key Tasks and Accomplishments:

1. **Order Fluctuations:**
   I conducted a meticulous evaluation of daily order fluctuations, completing the necessary columns in the 'Session Details' worksheet. Additionally, I identified specific dates with notable order highs and lows in comparison to the corresponding day of the previous week. This exploration provided valuable insights into customer behavior.

2. **Traffic Analysis:**
   Scrutinizing changes in web traffic vis-a-vis the previous week, I delved into potential shifts in traffic sources utilizing the 'Channel Wise Traffic' sheet. This analysis contributed to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing variations in user engagement.

3. **Conversion Analysis:**
   By examining overall conversion rates and dissecting them into distinct components (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O), I pinpointed conversions exhibiting fluctuations. Formulating hypotheses to explain these variations, I considered the multifaceted factors influencing user behavior.

4. **Hypothesis Validation:**
   To validate the hypotheses, I leveraged data available in the 'Supporting Data' sheet, gaining insights into the root causes behind fluctuations in conversion rates.

The culmination of this project was a comprehensive Funnel Analysis Report. This report not only presented findings and insights but also provided detailed explanations for order fluctuations, alterations in web traffic, and shifts in conversion rates.
